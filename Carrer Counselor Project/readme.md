# Gyan Mitra: An AI Career Counselor for Rural Youth üöÄ
Gyan Mitra (meaning "Knowledge Friend" in Hindi) is an AI-powered conversational agent designed to provide accessible and personalized career guidance to youth in rural areas. This project was developed as a key deliverable for the AI/Cloud internship with IBM SkillsBuild and Edunet Foundation.

# üìù The Challenge: Bridging the Career Guidance Gap
In rural communities, access to structured career counseling is severely limited. This challenge stems from a lack of professional counselors, a scarcity of information on skill development opportunities, and an overall absence of awareness regarding job-oriented courses and government schemes.

## The consequence of this knowledge gap is significant:
- Skill Mismatch: Students often pursue academic paths without a clear understanding of market demands.
- Underemployment: Youth struggle to find jobs that align with their skills, leading to underemployment and economic stagnation.
- Lost Potential: The talent and potential of a vast, deserving population remain untapped, hindering both individual growth and regional development.
- Gyan Mitra was created to address this critical need, offering a scalable and localized solution to a nationwide problem.

## üí° The Solution: A Virtual Mentor Powered by AI
Gyan Mitra is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based agent that functions as a virtual career counselor. It uses advanced AI to make trusted, up-to-date information readily available to anyone with a smartphone, empowering them to make informed decisions about their future.

### How It Works:
The agent leverages the power of IBM watsonx.ai to retrieve and synthesize information from a curated knowledge base of government schemes, vocational courses, and job-oriented platforms. When a user asks a question, the agent:

- Retrieves: Searches its knowledge base for the most relevant documents.
- Generates: Uses the retrieved information to formulate a clear and personalized response.

### What Gyan Mitra Can Do:
- Answer Queries: Provides conversational answers to questions about career paths, educational courses, and required skills.
- Explain Schemes: Clarifies the purpose, eligibility, and application process for various government initiatives.
- Offer Guidance: Acts as a friendly guide, offering motivation and direction to students who feel lost or overwhelmed.

## ‚ú® Project Highlights
- RAG-based Architecture: Ensures every response is grounded in trusted data, eliminating the risk of misinformation.
- Conversational Interface: The agent's user-friendly chat interface makes it easy and intuitive for anyone to use, regardless of their technical background.
- Scalable and Accessible: The project's design is inherently scalable, allowing it to serve a large number of users simultaneously without resource constraints.
